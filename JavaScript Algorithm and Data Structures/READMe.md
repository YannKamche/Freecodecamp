## Basic JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

## ES6
ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.

## Regular Expressions
Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.
